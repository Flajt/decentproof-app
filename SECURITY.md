# Decentproof Security.md
Thanks for visiting, this small file outlines what to do in the case that you have found an exploit / vulnerability.

## How to Report a vulnerability?
You can either use the issue template for security related issues (which will open a **[private](https://github.com/Flajt/decentproof-app/security/advisories/new)** issue), or send an E-Mail at <flajt[at]protonmail[dot]com> (Use something like: Decentproof App/Backend Vulerability Report, so I can figure out what it is).


### What to include?
- App Version
- A short description of the vulnerability (what does it do, what do I need to exploit it etc.)
- The possible damage that can be inflicted
- A step by step guide on how to exploit / trigger it
- If you can setup and easy to use repository it would be cool but not required
- If possible a way to fix / resolve it

You can also check out this guide by [owasp](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Vulnerability_Disclosure_Cheat_Sheet.html)
for what to include in your disclosure.

### What happends now?
I will try to respond in up to 48 hours from there we can discuss additional steps.

> Please don't share this vulerabilty with 3rd parties for the time beeing until a propper fix has been implemented. 

I will try to fix the issue asap. In the process I might reach out with questions.

## Important
>I can't and will not pay you money in case you claim to have found an exploit and want to share it only after a payment. Please save your and my time in this case, I appreciate it.

## Afterwards
- If you want I will add you to the README (if there is no section for it yet, I will create it)
- I will thank you if I didn't do that before
- Feel free to publish it in any way you want (Depending on the severity of the issue I will request a small wait time so users have time to download the patches)

## Something missing?

If you think something is not listed here but should be added, feel free to add it to your issue / E-Mail. Or open a discussion / issue to improve this file.
