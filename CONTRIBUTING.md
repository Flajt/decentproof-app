## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the
[Decentproof Code of Conduct](blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
By participating, you are expected to uphold this code!


## I Have a Question

> If you want to ask a question, we assume that you have read the available [Documentation]().

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing [Discussions](/discussions) that might help you. In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question in this issue. It is also advisable to search the internet for answers first.

If you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, I recommend the following:

- Navigate to [Discussions](/discussions)
- Create a new Discussion
- Decide on short, fitting title
- Write your question

I will try to reply to it. 

Please don't open an issue if it's not related to implementation (code, design, bugs etc.).
If you are not sure, just choose what you think is right.



<!--
You might want to create a separate issue tag for questions and include it in this description. People should then tag their issues accordingly.

Depending on how large the project is, you may want to outsource the questioning, e.g. to Stack Overflow or Gitter. You may add additional contact and information possibilities:
- IRC
- Slack
- Gitter
- Stack Overflow tag
- Blog
- FAQ
- Roadmap
- E-Mail List
- Forum

### Reporting Bugs

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Before Submitting a Bug Report

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Therefore, I ask you to investigate carefully, collect information and describe the issue in detail in your report. Please complete the following steps in advance to help us fix any potential bug as fast as possible.

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Determine if your bug is really a bug and not an error on your side e.g. using incompatible environment components/versions (Make sure that you have read the [documentation](). If you are looking for support, you might want to check [this section](#i-have-a-question)).
- To see if other users have experienced (and potentially already solved) the same issue you are having, check if there is not already a bug report existing for your bug or error in the [bug tracker](issues?q=label%3Abug).
- Also make sure to search the internet (including Stack Overflow) to see if users outside of the GitHub community have discussed the issue.
- Collect information about the bug:
- Stack trace (Traceback)
- OS, Platform and Version (Windows, Linux, macOS, x86, ARM)
- Version of the interpreter, compiler, SDK, runtime environment, package manager, depending on what seems relevant.
- Possibly your input and the output
- Can you reliably reproduce the issue? And can you also reproduce it with older versions?

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### How Do I Submit a Good Bug Report?

> Sensitive or Security related issues should use the dedicated template in the issue tracker or via E-Mail me at: flajt[at]protonmail[dot]com
<!-- You may add a PGP key to allow the messages to be sent encrypted as well. -->

We use GitHub issues to track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue with the project:

- Open an [Issue](/issues/new).
- Try to find the best possible lables for it
- Explain the behavior you would expect and the actual behavior.
- Please provide as much context as possible and describe the *reproduction steps* that someone else can follow to recreate the issue on their own. This usually includes your code. For good bug reports you should isolate the problem and create a reduced test case.
- Provide the information you collected in the previous section.

Once it's filed:

- I will label the issue accordingly if required.
- I will try to reproduce the issue with your provided steps. If there are no reproduction steps or no obvious way to reproduce the issue, the team will ask you for those steps and mark the issue as `more-info-required`.
- If I can reproduce it, I will assign a prio label to it and it will get [implemented by someone](#your-first-code-contribution).

<!-- You might want to create an issue template for bugs and errors that can be used as a guide and that defines the structure of the information to be included. If you do so, reference it here in the description. -->


### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for Decentproof, **including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality**. Following these guidelines will help maintainers and the community to understand your suggestion and find related suggestions.

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Before Submitting an Enhancement

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Read the [documentation]() carefully and find out if the functionality is already covered, maybe by an individual configuration.
- Perform a [search](/issues) to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
- Find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to you to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Keep in mind that we want features that will be useful to the majority of our users and not just a small subset. If you're just targeting a minority of users, consider writing an add-on/plugin library.

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### How Do I Submit a Good Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](/issues).

- Use a **clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
- Provide a **step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
- **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why. At this point you can also tell which alternatives do not work for you.
- You may want to **include screenshots and animated GIFs** which help you demonstrate the steps or point out the part which the suggestion is related to. You can use [this tool](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and [this tool](https://github.com/colinkeenan/silentcast) or [this tool](https://github.com/GNOME/byzanz) on Linux. <!-- this should only be included if the project has a GUI -->
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most Decentproof users. You may also want to point out the other projects that solved it better and which could serve as inspiration.
- If you are not sure yet, you can also open a discussion to gather additional input

<!-- You might want to create an issue template for enhancement suggestions that can be used as a guide and that defines the structure of the information to be included. If you do so, reference it here in the description. -->


### Adding Translations
I've decided to use [inlang](https://inlang.com) for translation (mainly because it's the first service I've stumbled across)
- To add you can simply go to the README.md and click on the translation status image
- From there you will be redirected to the online editor
- You can sign in with your github account and start editing
- You might need to open a second PR in case the language is not yet supported by the app and add the local definition under `main.dart` (you just need to add a `Local("your-lang-code-here")` to the other ones like `Locale("de")` etc.)  #TODO: Update section after testing


### Your First Code Contribution
1. Select an issue you think you can manage (if you are a unsure I will try to add `good-first-issue` tags, these should be easy to do)
2. Just request if you can handle it
3. Follow the setup instructions in the README file
4. Create yourself a branch, you can either do it by creating it directly from the issue or name it as close as you can to the issue title
5. Start working on it
6. If you are done, add some tests. If it would require E2E testing or native functionality mock it the best you can.
7. Open a PR 
8. Wait for someone (me) to review your PR and merge it
9. Congrats, your PR has been successfully merged

If you are unsure feel free to ask questions under the issue.

### Improving The Documentation
1. If there is not an existing issue for what you want to change, open it up (if you are unsure consider opening a discussion to gather insides)
2. Label yourself accordingly 
3. Wait for me to respond
4. If I give you the thumbs up, you can start working on it, just create a branch and you are good to go.
5. Open a PR against `dev`
6. Wait for me to review and merge it
7. Congrats, your PR was successfully merged


## "Style Guide"
Some tips on how to write project fitting code. If you find something missing or odd, please, open a discussion.

### Caseing
- `UpperCamelCase` is the way in this project, from **file names** to **classes**
- `lowerCamelCase` should be used **functions** and **methods** and **folders**

### Naming
- `XXXXWrapper` for anything that just wraps a **package** / **native interface**
- `XXXXService` for any logic related stuff (might need some more speration at some point, thoughts are welcome)
- `XXXPage.dart` for any **page** files
- `IXXXS` for **interfaces**

### Folders
- `util` for utility
- `logic` for services
- `uiblocks` for widgets
- `bloc` or `xxxBloc` for BLOCs
- `shared` for any shared code (only under lib)


#### BLOCs
Have a look at this: [https://bloclibrary.dev/#/blocnamingconventions](https://bloclibrary.dev/#/blocnamingconventions), _ideally_ everything should be named like this. (I guess)

### Structure
This project attempts a feature based structure, you create a top level folder `featureName` followed by the folders you need see [Folders](#folders) for more information.

### Interfaces
Nearly all classes have interface, so make sure yours do as well. This is used for dependency injection via `get_it` if required.

### Dependency Injection
If you want to use a class in any other class please use dependecy injection with `get_it`.

#### Register a dependency
To register a class go to [register.dart](/lib/shared/util/register.dart) and register by using `getIt.registerFactory<MyInterface>(()=>MyClass())` if you are not sure check the file for the most common use cases 

#### Using depencies
- Create a `get_it` instance
- Use it to retrive class
E.g.

```dart
final getIt = GetIt.I;

final myClass = getIt.get<MyInterface>();
await myClass.myFunction(my-paramerterA, my-parameterB);
```

### Where To Use Services

Services should used in BLOCs, or other Services, which ideally are used by a BLOC.

BLOCs should be the thing between our Widgets and our Services!
If there is a dozen Services running in a BLOC, you can consider wrapping it in a Special Service, if you want to do that please open a discussion and tag me so we can find a propper naming convention for that.

Idealy a feature looks like this:<br>
-----> = Implemented By <br>
Services can of course implement multiple Wrappers and other services if desired, however try to keep it resonable.

PackageServiceWrapper ------> MyFeatureService ----> My Feature Bloc


### When To Create
Here you can check what you need to create for certain operations.

#### Wrappers
If you need to abstract a over a package or native logic? Create a wrapper
Examples: 
- [ImagePickerWrapper](/lib/features/hashing/logic/ImagePickerWrapper.dart) 
- [SecureStorageWrapper](/lib/shared/Integrety/SecureStorageWrapper.dart)

#### Services
A specific feature or subfeature requires logic? Create a Service! (don't forget the interface)
Examples:
- [ImageSavingService](lib/features/hashing/logic/ImageSavingService.dart)
- [MetaDataPermissionService](lib/features/metadata/logic/MetaDataPermissionService.dart)

#### BLOCs
You need to change state? Use a BLOC
Examples:
- [PreparationBloc](/lib/features/hashing/bloc/PreparationBloc/PreparationBloc.dart)
- [VerificationBloc](/lib/features/verification/bloc/VerificationBloc.dart)
